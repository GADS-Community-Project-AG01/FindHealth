# FindHealth

This app was built as a submission for the Google Android Developer Scholarship by members of group AG01.

**SUBMISSION STATEMENT**

The app aims to ease the decision making process around what healthcare
 facility is available, in order to allow for making an informed choice when seeking healthcare in 
times of emergency; as may result from a covid infection or otherwise.

**HOW IT WORKS**

At runtime the app asks for permission to use your location. when permission 
is granted, pressing the FAB generates a list of nearby hospitals along with information 
to aid in making an informed decision.
